# NXS Spa Portal — Briefing

Always load this file first in any AI session on this repo.

## Project

NXS Spa Portal: reception management console + client mobile app for a
male-only spa in Cubao, PH. This repo currently contains the reception
console (Next.js app). The client-facing mobile app is a separate,
not-yet-built surface referenced by the schema (client login fields, QR
tokens) but not present in this codebase.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind) — see `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`
  for this project's Next.js conventions before writing code; this is not the
  Next.js you may know from training data.
- Supabase (Postgres 17), project ref `zqwiqrvqyinacjozubtc`, region ap-southeast-1.
- Vercel hosting (`vercel.json` present at repo root).
- Client access via `@supabase/ssr`: `lib/supabase/server.ts` (server components,
  cookie-based) and `lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser). Both use the anon key —
  reads are governed by RLS, not a service-role bypass.

## Locked architectural decisions

These are enforced in the live schema (verified directly against the
Supabase project, migrations `01`–`12`). Do not silently change any of these.
Full invariant list: [[nxs-architecture-locks]].

1. **Points Ledger is immutable/append-only, DB-trigger enforced.**
   `point_transactions` has `trg_block_ledger_update` and
   `trg_block_ledger_delete` (function `block_ledger_mutation()`) that reject
   any UPDATE or DELETE outright — not just app-level convention. Balance
   changes apply via `trg_apply_points_delta` (`apply_points_delta()`) on
   INSERT only. See [[points_ledger_state]].

2. **Bookings — DB-enforced no-double-booking via GiST exclusion constraints.**
   Two constraints on `bookings`: `no_double_book_room` and
   `no_double_book_therapist`, both `EXCLUDE USING gist (<resource> WITH =,
   tsrange(start_ts, end_ts) WITH &&)`, scoped to active statuses (`Booked`,
   `Completed`, `Needs Reassignment`). See [[bookings_state]].

3. **Sales — mutable, separate domain from the ledger.** `sales` is its own
   table (voidable, editable, has `edited_by`/`voided_by` audit columns) and
   is cross-referenced from `point_transactions` only via the optional
   `sale_id` FK. The two domains are never merged into one table or view.
   See [[sales_state]].

4. **Client privacy.** `clients.codename` is the only display identity in the
   schema — there is no legal-name column at all. `clients` has one
   `password_hash` column (single credential per client, consistent with
   one-device login intent, though nothing in the schema technically
   prevents concurrent sessions on that credential — enforcement would be
   app-level, not yet built). No "companion tagging" construct exists in the
   schema. See [[clients_state]].

5. **Staff Auth — intentionally deferred; RLS state as of Core Loop
   (`ohm#7f3k9d2m`, 2026-08-27):** RLS is enabled (`ENABLE ROW LEVEL
   SECURITY`) on every `public` table. Public SELECT policies exist on
   `lockers`, `rooms`, `services`, `therapists` (pre-existing), plus
   `clients`, `staff`, `point_transactions` (added by Core Loop, all
   `USING (true)`). Public INSERT-only policies exist on
   `point_transactions`, `sales`, `action_logs` (added by Core Loop,
   `WITH CHECK (true)`) — deliberately no SELECT on `sales`/`action_logs`
   (nothing reads them from the app yet) and no UPDATE/DELETE anywhere.
   Every other table — `bookings`, `promos`, `addons`, `sale_addons`,
   `locker_occupancy`, the `therapist_*` tables — still has no policies at
   all: default-deny for `anon`/`authenticated`. **This is additive, not a
   re-open**: each policy was scoped to exactly what a Core Loop read/write
   needed, decided explicitly with the user rather than assumed. One
   related fix: `clients.points_balance` sync trigger
   (`apply_points_delta()`) had to be made `SECURITY DEFINER`, since
   `clients` intentionally has no UPDATE policy for `anon` and the trigger's
   internal update was otherwise silently blocked by RLS too — see
   [[points_ledger_state]]. Action Logs use a placeholder-actor dropdown in
   the interim (staff picked from a list, not an authenticated session),
   now actually built — see [[staff_state]] and [[logs_state]].

## Routing to more detail

- Module-by-module current behavior: `.ai/current_state.md` → `docs/state/*.md`
- Active sprint / in-progress: `.ai/handoff.md`
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/system.md`, `rbac.md`, `workflow.md`
- Compact invariant list: `.ai/architecture_locks/ADR-001-nxs-spa-architecture.md`

## Last Completed Tasks

(Newest on top, keep only 5.)

1. **2026-08-27 — Core Loop: Client Profile Actions, Points Ledger, Log
   Visit Modal** (`ohm#7f3k9d2m`). Plan presented and approved before any
   code, per the prompt's mandatory gate. Added `public.log_visit(...)`
   (atomic ledger + optional sale + action log insert in one transaction),
   Log Visit UI on Client Profile, and narrow additive RLS policies for the
   five tables this needed — see the RLS invariant above and
   [[points_ledger_state]] for detail. Fixed a latent bug this surfaced:
   `apply_points_delta()` needed `SECURITY DEFINER` to update `clients`
   under RLS. Verified with a rolled-back SQL transaction (earn, pure
   redemption, insufficient-balance guard, redemption-with-upgrade,
   immutability) before writing app code, then re-verified live through the
   real UI in a browser. Staff Auth still deferred; not a regression.
2. **2026-08-27 — Bootstrap shared context doc system** (`ohm#3q8n5t1x`).
   Created `.ai/` + `docs/state/` + `docs/architecture/` doc scaffold by
   reading the live Supabase schema (migrations, constraints, triggers, RLS
   policies) and the actual Next.js app tree, rather than assuming prior
   OHMployee-pattern content. Found and corrected one assumption in the
   original prompt (RLS is enabled + mostly closed, not "open"). No app code,
   schema, or migrations touched.
